Stock Predictor Algorithm Using Machine Learning

Imports:
It imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and handling warnings.

Reading Data:
The script reads a CSV file containing historical stock data of Nvidia (NVDA).

Data Preprocessing:
It converts the 'Date' column to datetime format.
Extracts quarter end dates from the 'Date' column.
Extracts additional date features like day, month, and year.
Drops redundant columns like 'Adj Close'.
Checks for null values.
Visualizes the distribution and boxplot of various features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

Feature Engineering:
Calculates new features like 'open-close' (the difference between Open and Close prices) and 'low-high' (the difference between Low and High prices).
Creates a target variable by comparing the Close price of a day with the Close price of the next day. If the next day's Close price is higher, the target is 1, otherwise 0.

Visualization:
Visualizes the distribution of the target variable.
Generates a correlation heatmap to visualize the correlation between features.

Model Training:
Splits the data into training and validation sets.
Scales the features using StandardScaler.
Initializes three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (with a polynomial kernel), and XGBoost Classifier.
Trains each model on the training data.
Evaluates the training and validation accuracies of each model using ROC AUC score, which measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.

Evaluation:
Plots a confusion matrix for the first model (Logistic Regression) to visualize the performance on the validation set.

Overall, this script demonstrates a basic workflow for stock price prediction using machine learning techniques. However, it's worth noting that stock price prediction is
a complex and uncertain task influenced by various factors, and the performance of such models may vary significantly in real-world scenarios. Additionally, this code could 
be extended and optimized further for better performance.
